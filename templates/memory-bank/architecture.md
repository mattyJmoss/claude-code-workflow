# Architecture

## System Overview
<!-- High-level description of the system's components and how they interact -->
<!-- Include a text diagram if helpful (e.g., Client → API → Database) -->

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Client | | |
| Server | | |
| Storage | | |
| Auth | | |

## Layer Architecture
<!-- Describe the layers/modules and their responsibilities -->
<!-- Document dependency direction: which layers can import which -->

## Key Data Flows
<!-- Describe the most important data flows through the system -->
<!-- e.g., "User creates a note" → step by step through the layers -->

## Architecture Decisions
