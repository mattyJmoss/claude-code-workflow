# Issues & Observations

A lightweight parking lot for bugs, tech debt, and observations noticed during work that don't warrant a Plane ticket yet. Add anything unrelated to the current task here rather than fixing it in scope.

During `/techdebt`, Claude reads this file and promotes items to tickets when they're worth tracking formally. During `/kickoff`, Claude scans for items relevant to the current work.
