# Data Schema Reference

<!-- Fill this in as data models are created. For each storage layer, document:
     - Key/table/collection name and pattern
     - Value shape (TypeScript type or JSON example)
     - Relationships to other entities
     - TTL or expiration rules (if applicable)
     - Size constraints or limits -->

## Primary Storage

<!-- Your main database/storage layer. Examples:
     - SQL tables and their columns
     - Durable Object storage keys and value shapes
     - Document collections and their schemas -->

## Secondary Storage

<!-- Caches, indexes, ephemeral storage. Examples:
     - KV key patterns and TTLs
     - Redis keys
     - In-memory caches -->

## Object/File Storage

<!-- Binary data, uploads, media. Examples:
     - R2/S3 bucket naming conventions
     - File format and size limits
     - Encryption details -->

## Client-Side Storage

<!-- What the client stores locally. Examples:
     - AsyncStorage/UserDefaults keys
     - Keychain/SecureStore entries
     - Local database tables -->
